# How to install

1. Download source at https://github.com/CaMapConDuDuDu/attendance.moneyforward.com/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip
2. Extract source to anywhere you would like to, in this example I take "D:\auto-attendance\"
After that, it should look like:

```
D:
|
+---auto-attendance/
|   |
|   +---manifest.json
|   +---css/
|   |   |
|   |   +---...
|   +---images/
|   |   |
|   |   +---...
|   +---layouts/
|   |   |
|   |   +---...
|   +---scripts/
|   |   |
|   |   +---...
```

3. And then, we open ***Google Chrome***, or a browser which built from ***Chromium*** core
4. Open extensions link, in case of ***Google Chrome***, we use:
```
chrome://extensions/
```
5. And now, look at the top right of the screen, there is a small switch labeled ***Developer mode***, it should be ***ON***
6. Then, click ***Load unpacked***, and browse to "D:\auto-attendance\"
7. Finally, you should see a small gear icon, let pin it
